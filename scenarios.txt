My significant other broke up with me
I ate a whole pizza
I got a D on an exam
I had a big fight with my best friend
Lately it has been harder to button my jeans in the morning
I made a mistake at work and got yelled at
I am going to the beach this weekend and will have to wear a bikini
I missed a workout because I got too busy
I was served a high-calorie meal and was too polite to refuse
Finals are coming up next week
I ate four doughnuts at breakfast
After dinner I ate a whole pint of ice cream
My friend came over to bake cookies and left them all with me
I am visiting a friend I have not seen in months
I am PMSing and am feeling bloated
My friend commented on my weight
I am attending a wedding next week and need to slim down
Clothes from last season do not fit anymore
I stepped on the scale and did not like my weight
My date prefers skinny girls
